# The Cryptographer's Toolbox: Unraveling the Mysteries of Polyalphabetic and Caesar Ciphers 🧰

Welcome, fellow codebreakers! This isn't just any old repository. Oh no. This is the Polyalphabetic and Caesar Cipher Repository, the Aston Martin of cryptography, if you will. Here, we don't just play with codes, we conquer them. 🕵️‍♀️

## Features 🔍
What's under the hood, you ask? Well, let me tell you:
- The Caesar cipher: It's like the reliable old Land Rover of ciphers. It might not be flashy, but it'll get you where you need to go. 🔱
- The Polyalphabetic cipher: This is the Bugatti Veyron of ciphers. It's complex, it's sophisticated, and it's probably too clever for its own good. 🌀

## Usage 🛠️
To get started, clone this repository, navigate to the directory, and run the Python scripts. It's as easy as driving a straight line, unless you're James May.

### Examples 💡
Here's how to get these beasts purring:
- To encrypt a message using the Caesar cipher, run `python caesar_cipher.py -e "Your Message"`
- To decrypt a message using the Polyalphabetic cipher, run `python polyalphabetic_cipher.py -d "Your Encrypted Message"`

And remember, how many bitcoin miners does it take to change a light bulb? A million – one to do it and the rest to verify he did it. Now, isn't that a bright idea? 💡
