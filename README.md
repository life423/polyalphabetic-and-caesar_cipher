# Cipher Tool Project

A Python application for encrypting and decrypting text using Caesar and Polyalphabetic (Vigen√®re) ciphers. This project provides both a GUI interface and a command-line interface.

## Project Structure

The project has been refactored to follow a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **cipher_core.py**: Core cipher algorithms without any I/O or business logic
- **file_service.py**: Handles all file operations
- **cipher_service.py**: Service layer coordinating cipher operations and file handling
- **cipher_gui.py**: User interface that delegates all processing to the service layer
- **cipher_tool.py**: Backward compatibility wrapper for existing scripts

## Key Improvements

### 1. Separation of Concerns
- **Business Logic vs. UI**: Clear separation between encryption logic and GUI code
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has a clear, focused purpose
- **Core Algorithms**: Core cipher implementations are now isolated and reusable

### 2. Better Code Organization
- **Layered Architecture**: 
  - Core functionality (cipher algorithms)
  - Services (file operations and coordination)
  - Presentation (GUI)
- **Simplified Dependencies**: Each layer only depends on layers below it

### 3. Enhanced Usability
- Added option to control file deletion after processing
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- More intuitive variable naming throughout the codebase
- AI-driven analysis to guess encryption keys and suggest plaintext

### 4. AI-Powered Analysis
- **Caesar Cipher Analysis**: Automatically determines the most likely shift key using:
  - Letter frequency analysis
  - English language pattern detection
  - Common word identification
- **Polyalphabetic Cipher Analysis**: Guesses possible keywords by:
  - Key length estimation using index of coincidence
  - Column-wise frequency analysis
  - Plaintext validation through language patterns
- **User-Friendly Interface**:
  - Displays top key suggestions with confidence scores
  - Shows sample decryptions for each suggestion
  - One-click application of suggested keys

### 4. Improved Documentation
- Comprehensive docstrings explaining module and function purposes
- Clear parameter and return value documentation
- Comments for complex operations and algorithms

## How to Use

### GUI Interface

Run the GUI application with:
```
python cipher_gui.py
```

### Command Line Interface

Run the command-line interface with:
```
python cipher_service.py
```

## Additional Notes

This project demonstrates clean code principles including:
- Separation of concerns
- Single responsibility principle
- Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)
- Clear and descriptive naming conventions
- Comprehensive documentation
